    <string key="desc_o_class">O-type stars are incredibly hot and massive, with temperatures reaching up to 60,000 K. They emit a tremendous amount of ultraviolet radiation and have a very short lifespan, living only a few million years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</string>
    <string key="desc_b_class">B-type stars are also hot and luminous, with temperatures ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 K. They have a relatively short lifespan compared to other star types, living up to 100 million years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon and nitrogen.</string>
    <string key="desc_a_class">A-type stars have temperatures ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 K, and have a moderate lifespan of around 1 billion years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.</string>
    <string key="desc_f_class">F-type stars have temperatures ranging from 6,000 to 7,500 K, and have a longer lifespan of around 3 billion years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron.</string>
    <string key="desc_g_class">G-type stars, like our sun, have temperatures around 5,500 K and have a lifespan of around 10 billion years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron.</string>
    <string key="desc_k_class">K-type stars have temperatures ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 K and have a longer lifespan of around 30 billion years. They are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, silicon, and magnesium.</string>
    <string key="desc_m_class">M-type stars are the coolest and have temperatures of less than 3,500 K. They have a longer lifespan of around 100 billion years and are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, silicon, and magnesium.</string>
